We take the security of our project very seriously. We are committed to promptly addressing any vulnerabilities that may be discovered.
This document outlines the security policy for this project.  It details how to report vulnerabilities and our approach to addressing them.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
We appreciate your help in keeping this project secure. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly by following these steps:
1. **Email**: Send an [email](mailto:adityaiukumar%40gmail.com?subject=KhojoMojo%20Vulnerability) with a detailed description of the vulnerability.
2. **Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability.** This should include:
* Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
* Expected behavior vs. actual behavior.
* Any screenshots or code snippets that help illustrate the issue.
3. **Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability.** Publicly disclosing a vulnerability before it is fixed can be exploited by attackers.
4. **We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 72 hours.** We will keep you informed of the progress of fixing the vulnerability.
5. **If the vulnerability is confirmed and considered a security risk, we will strive to release a fix within 1 week** (depending on severity). We will also provide a public disclosure acknowledging your contribution.
6. **We will not disclose your identity publicly without your permission.**
